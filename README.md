# Pixel-Game-Engine
(Part 1 of uploading old and small projects made by me to GitHub. Contains unique and simple ideas.) A basic engine for creating two-coloured pixel games.

See the [Test Game](TestGame2.java) as example. This example uses Java Swing and displays the game on a field of 20 x 20 JButtons. Of course, don't do that! To use your own way of displaying, just replace the classes PixelPanel and PixelFrame by something more efficient.
